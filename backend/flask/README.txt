README for Trilateration Flask API
Overview

This Flask application provides an API for processing satellite signals to determine the position of a device using trilateration. The application accepts satellite positions and pseudoranges, performs calculations to find the device's location, and returns the results in JSON format.
Features

    Accepts POST requests with satellite data and pseudoranges.
    Uses least squares optimization to calculate the device's position.
    Returns the calculated position in a structured JSON response.
    Handles errors and provides appropriate HTTP status codes.

Dependencies

To run this application, you need to have the following Python packages installed:

    Flask: A lightweight WSGI web application framework for Python.
    NumPy: A library for numerical computations in Python.
    SciPy: A library used for scientific and technical computing, specifically for optimization in this application.

Installation

    Set Up a Virtual Environment (optional but recommended):

    Open your terminal or command prompt and create a virtual environment:

python -m venv venv

Activate the virtual environment:

    On Windows:

venv\Scripts\activate

On macOS/Linux:

    source venv/bin/activate

Install Dependencies: Install the required Python packages using pip:

pip install Flask numpy scipy

Run the Application: Start the Flask application by executing the following command:

    python <flask-app-file>.py

    Replace <flask-app-file> with the name of your Python file containing the Flask code. The server will start and listen on port 4000.

API Endpoint
POST /process_signals

    Description: This endpoint processes incoming satellite signals and calculates the device's position using trilateration.
    Request Body: The request should contain a JSON object with the following structure:

{
    "satellite_data": [
        {"position": [x1, y1, z1]},
        {"position": [x2, y2, z2]},
        {"position": [x3, y3, z3]},
        {"position": [x4, y4, z4]}
    ],
    "pseudoranges": [p1, p2, p3, p4]
}

    Response: The response will be a JSON object containing the device position:


{
    "device_position": {
        "x": <x-coordinate>,
        "y": <y-coordinate>,
        "z": <z-coordinate>
    }
}

    Error Handling: If the request fails or if the device position is not found, the server will return an error message with an appropriate status code.

Mathematical Foundation
Trilateration

Trilateration is a method used to determine the position of a point based on its distances from three or more known points (satellites). The basic idea is to use the distances (pseudoranges) to calculate the coordinates of the device.

    Distance Calculation: The distance between the device and each satellite is calculated using the Euclidean distance formula.

    Optimization: The least squares method is used to minimize the difference between the calculated distances and the provided pseudoranges. This is done by solving the following residuals function:

    residuals = distance - pseudorange

    Result: The optimization process yields the estimated coordinates (x, y, z) of the device.

Example Calculation

Given the following satellite positions and pseudoranges:

    Satellite Positions:
        Satellite 1: (x1, y1, z1)
        Satellite 2: (x2, y2, z2)
        Satellite 3: (x3, y3, z3)
        Satellite 4: (x4, y4, z4)

    Pseudoranges:
        p1, p2, p3, p4

The application will calculate the device's position based on these inputs.
